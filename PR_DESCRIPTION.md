# Database and Authentication Implementation

## Overview
This PR implements the core database functionality, authentication system, and API endpoints for the Resume Builder application. It sets up a PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM and implements JWT-based authentication with protected routes.

## Changes

### Database Setup
- Configured PostgreSQL database connection with Prisma ORM
- Created Prisma schema with models for User, Resume, Education, Experience, Project, Skill, and Certification
- Implemented database services for performing CRUD operations
- Added utility functions for database connection management

### Authentication System
- Implemented JWT-based authentication with HTTP-only cookies
- Created API routes for user registration, login, logout, and profile retrieval
- Added middleware for protecting routes that require authentication
- Implemented client-side authentication context for managing user state
- Added authentication-related UI components and form validation

### API Routes
- Implemented API endpoints for user management
- Created endpoints for resume creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion
- Added validation with Zod for all API inputs
- Implemented error handling for API routes

### UI Updates
- Updated login and signup pages to use the authentication context
- Added toast notifications for authentication events
- Implemented loading states for form submissions

### Other Improvements
- Enhanced project documentation in README
- Added detailed error logging
- Created a debug API endpoint for testing database connectivity

## How to Test
1. Clone the repository
2. Set up environment variables as described in the README
3. Run `npx prisma generate` to generate the Prisma client
4. Run `npx prisma migrate dev` to create the database and apply migrations
5. Start the development server with `pnpm dev`
6. Test user registration and login flows
7. Test resume creation and management
