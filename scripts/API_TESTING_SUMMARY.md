# API Testing Summary and Troubleshooting Guide

## Issues Identified

1. **Auth Check on Initial Page Load**:
   - Error: Authentication check running on the landing page causing `Auth check failed with status 500`
   - Solution: Modified the auth-context.tsx to skip auth checks on public routes

2. **Missing Prisma Client**:
   - Error: `Cannot find module '.prisma/client/default'`
   - Solution: Generated Prisma client with `npx prisma generate`

3. **Missing DATABASE_URL Environment Variable**:
   - Error: `Environment variable not found: DATABASE_URL`
   - Solution: Created a .env file with proper PostgreSQL connection string

## API Testing Process

We created two testing scripts to validate your API endpoints:

1. **Auth API Tests** (`scripts/test-auth-api.js`):
   - Tests registration
   - Tests login
   - Tests the `/me` endpoint
   - Tests logout

2. **Resume API Tests** (`scripts/test-resume-api.js`):
   - Tests resume creation
   - Tests resume retrieval
   - Tests resume updating
   - Tests resume analysis

## How to Run the Tests

1. Make sure your Next.js development server is running:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Run the auth API tests:
   ```
   cd scripts
   npm install  # Only needed first time
   node test-auth-api.js
   ```

3. Run the resume API tests:
   ```
   node test-resume-api.js
   ```

## Database Setup

To run the tests successfully, you need a PostgreSQL database. You can:

1. Use a local PostgreSQL instance:
   - Update the .env file with your local database credentials
   - Run `npx prisma migrate dev` to create the database schema

2. Or use a test database:
   - Update the .env file with test database credentials
   - Run `npx prisma migrate dev` to create the database schema

## Changes Made to Fix the Issues

1. **Modified Auth Context**: Updated auth-context.tsx to:
   - Add lists of protected routes and public routes
   - Skip auth checks on initial load for public routes
   - Only redirect on auth failures for protected routes

2. **Improved /me Endpoint**: Updated app/api/auth/me/route.ts to:
   - Return cleaner responses for unauthenticated requests
   - Include an 'authenticated' flag in all responses
   - Clean up invalid auth cookies automatically

3. **Environment Setup**: Created .env file with necessary configuration:
   - Added DATABASE_URL for Prisma connection
   - Added NEXTAUTH_SECRET for JWT token signing

## Next Steps

1. **Database Setup**: 
   - Set up a proper PostgreSQL database 
   - Run migrations to create the schema

2. **Continue Testing**:
   - Run the test scripts again after setting up the database
   - Fix any remaining issues that come up

3. **Monitor in Production**:
   - Add proper error logging to catch auth issues
   - Consider implementing error boundaries in the frontend
