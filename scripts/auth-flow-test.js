/**
 * This script doesn't actually test the authentication flow,
 * but documents the expected flow for verification:
 * 
 * 1. User visits /signup
 *    - If already authenticated, redirected to /dashboard (via middleware)
 *    - If not authenticated, shows signup form
 * 
 * 2. User submits signup form
 *    - On success: redirected to /login?registered=true
 *    - Login page shows success toast
 * 
 * 3. User enters credentials on login page
 *    - On success: redirected to /dashboard
 *    - If there was a callbackUrl param, redirected there instead
 * 
 * 4. User tries to access protected route (e.g., /dashboard) without authentication
 *    - Redirected to /login?callbackUrl=encodeURI('/dashboard')
 *    - After login, redirected back to original URL
