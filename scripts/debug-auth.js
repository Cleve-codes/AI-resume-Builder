Authentication Flow Explanation:

1. Login Process:
   - User submits credentials to /api/auth/login
   - Server authenticates and creates JWT token
   - Token is set as 'auth-token' cookie in response
   - Browser redirects to dashboard with window.location.href

2. Dashboard Load:
   - Middleware checks for 'auth-token' cookie
   - If token exists, allows access to dashboard
   - Dashboard component also checks auth state with useAuth()
   - If not authenticated, redirects back to login

3. Problem Areas & Solutions:
   
   A. Edge Runtime Limitations:
      - Middleware runs in Edge Runtime, which doesn't support Node.js crypto
      - Solution: We simplified middleware to only check token existence
      - Actual verification happens server-side in API routes

   B. Cookie Setting in API Response:
      - We updated login API to set cookie on response object
      - Using response.cookies.set instead of cookies() API from Next.js

   C. Client-side Redirects:
      - Using window.location.href for most reliable redirects
      - Next.js router.push() may have issues with authentication redirects
      
4. Debugging Process:
   - Check browser console for logs
   - Verify cookie is being set (Application tab > Cookies)
   - Look for middleware logs in server console
   - Confirm auth-token cookie is presented to server with requests

5. Manual Fix:
   - If all else fails, try manually accessing /dashboard after login
   - Clear cookies and cache before testing again
