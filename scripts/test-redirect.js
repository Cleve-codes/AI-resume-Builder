// Test script for dashboard redirection
console.log('Dashboard Redirect Test Script');

/**
 * Instructions for manual testing:
 * 
 * 1. Run the application (npm run dev)
 * 2. Open the browser console
 * 3. Navigate to /login
 * 4. Log in with valid credentials
 * 5. Check browser console for debug messages
 * 6. Observe if redirection to dashboard occurs
 * 
 * Alternative method:
 * 1. After login, manually enter '/dashboard' in the URL to see if it works
 * 
 * Debugging steps:
 * 1. Check if auth-token cookie is set after login (Use DevTools > Application > Cookies)
 * 2. Check console logs to see middleware execution
 * 3. Make sure the router.push('/dashboard') is being called in auth-context.tsx
 * 4. Try using window.location.href = '/dashboard' as a fallback

console.log('Important points to check:');
console.log('1. Is Next.js router causing issues? Try window.location.href instead');
console.log('2. Is cookie being set properly?');
console.log('3. Is middleware running when it should?');
console.log('4. Is there any JavaScript error in console?');

console.log('\nPotential solutions to try:');
console.log('1. Clear all browser cookies and try again');
console.log('2. Try using window.location.href = "/dashboard" instead of router.push');
console.log('3. Make sure not to prevent default on form submit without proper redirection');
console.log('4. Check for any race conditions in the auth state management');
